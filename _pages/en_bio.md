## Academic Path

I am about to pursue a M.Sc. degree in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza University. I am working on my master's thesis on Situation Calculus and Linear Temporal Logic.

I received a B.Sc. degree in Ingegneria Informatica e Automatica (Computer and Control Engineering) from Sapienza with 110 cum laude / 110 and I completed the excellence program for this degree.
