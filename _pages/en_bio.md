# Academic Path

I am about to pursue a M.Sc. degree in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza University. I received a B.Sc. degree in Ingegneria Informatica e Automatica (Computer and Control Engineering) from Sapienza with 110 cum laude / 110 and I completed the excellence program for this degree.

# Research Activities

I have just submitted my first paper to the [IEEE MLSP 2023](https://2023.ieeemlsp.org/) workshop on Machine Learning and I am working on my master's thesis on Situation Calculus and Linear Temporal Logic.

# Teaching Activities

I'm currently teaching as a tutor in two bachelor's degree courses taught at Sapienza University: Introduzione agli Algoritmi (Introduction to Algorithms) and Fondamenti di Informatica II (Fundamentals of Computer Science II). 

Previously, I worked as an assistant for the same university and as a private teacher for high school and university students.
