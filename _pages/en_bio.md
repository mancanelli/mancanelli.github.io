## Academic Path

I am about to begin the National PhD in Artificial Intelligence at Sapienza University.
I'm currently working on my masterâ€™s thesis on Situation Calculus and Linear Temporal Logic.

I received a B.Sc. degree in Ingegneria Informatica e Automatica (Computer and Control Engineering) from Sapienza with 110 cum laude / 110 and I completed the excellence program for this degree.
