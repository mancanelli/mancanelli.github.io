## About me

I am a first-year student in the National PhD programme in Artificial Intelligence at Sapienza University.
My research interests range from Logic and Symbolic Reasoning to applications of Neural Networks.
Now I'm currently working on Situation Calculus and Linear Temporal Logic.

I graduated with a M.Sc. degree in Engineering in Computer Science and a B.Sc. degree in Ingegneria Informatica 
e Automatica (Computer and Control Engineering) from La Sapienza, both with honors.
