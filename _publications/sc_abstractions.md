abstract: "We address a program synthesis task where one wants to provide a description of the behavior of common data structures and automatically synthesize a concrete program from a proper abstraction. Our framework is based on nondeterministic situation calculus, extended with LTL trace constraints. We propose a notion of temporally lifted abstraction to address the scenario in which we have a single high-level action theory/model with incomplete information and nondeterministic actions and a concrete action theory with several models and complete information. LTL formulas are used to specify the temporally extended goals as well as assumed trace constraints. We show that if the agent has a strategy to achieve a goal under trace constraints at the high level, then there is a refinement of the strategy to achieve the refinement of the goal at the low level."
